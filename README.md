# Gallery-of-colored-squares-TSX-
Gallery of colored squares (5 columns x 8 rows = 40 unique random colors), with filters to hide/show dynamically those matching only. All of them should be filtered by "category" (input select: red, green, yellow, blue, brown, gray, purple, pink, other) and by saturation (boolean/checbox: "darker" which can be random for each element).
